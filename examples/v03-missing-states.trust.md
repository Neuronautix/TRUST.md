# Missing-state declaration

`evidence_support: none` is an assessed low-support result. Calibration was
considered and deliberately `not-assessed`. Source integrity does not apply.
The absent `dimensions.review_status` makes no statement; it is distinct from
the provenance block's completed review of this declaration.
